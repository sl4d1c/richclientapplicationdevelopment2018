# Project description
Within the scope of our project we want to build an application for the creation of surveys. Users
should be given the opportunity to create or answer a survey. To create the survey, you can choose
from a predefined pool of elements. The survey creator can individually select elements from the pool
and add them to the survey, as well as different page layouts and different ways to answer the questions,
such as drop-down answers, multiple choice answers or whether answers are required. The responder
should then be able to answer the survey and his data should then be stored in a database. In the future
it may be possible to perform an analysis of the survey data for the creator.
